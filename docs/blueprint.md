## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#483D8B) to evoke a sense of luxury and exclusivity, fitting with the premium adult content.
- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#333333) to create a sophisticated and modern feel, while ensuring content visibility.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#8A2BE2) to draw attention to interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body text: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, is used for the majority of the text; it conveys a modern, neutral look. Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' to match the Inter, conveying a slightly computerized, techy look
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use high-resolution, minimalist icons. Use icons consistently throughout the platform to improve UX. Consider creating custom icons related to specific content genres or features.
- Employ a grid-based layout for clear content organization. Utilize modular sections to display different content types, such as live streams, videos on demand, and user profiles.
- Use subtle transitions for page loading and interactive elements, such as button hovers, but animations must not be distracting.
